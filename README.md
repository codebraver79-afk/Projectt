This website displays 3 sections where you can see the clothes, make outfits and plan for a specific day.

Technologies used: HTML,CSS and JS 

How to use the website:
Click on the chips with tops, bottoms... to only get the items you selected. Click on an item to start making an outfit. You can only pick one of each type (one top, one bottom...) and if you picked a top and a bottom, you can't pick a dress. After making an outfit, you can click on clear or save button. The outfit will be saved in the Outfits section. You can delete the outfit using the delete button.
In Planner section you can get the weather for the next 5 days with a description and a suggestion and you are able to plan your outfit for a specific day


AI used:
Copilot : used a lot of the inline suggestions in the HTML and it helped a lot with the JS part (best one so far);
v0.dev: used to get the style (easy to use but only allows limited requests);
replit ai : used its idea to section the page (also used for the style);
Mymap ai :used it for the JS part about the weather in the planner section (it was a little bit complicated to work with);
